### ADJUNCT PROFESSOR | VASSAR COLLEGE | JAN 2021 – PRESENT

Taught senior-level Operating Systems course required for graduation.  Course covered the main areas of current and legacy techniques that underpin modern systems.  Topics are organized into three sections: Virtualization, Concurrency, and Persistence.  Homeworks included a combination of written logical answers, algorithm traces, python utilities, and C-based programming development.  Students were also introduced to technologies useful to post-college careers such as GitHub.

### SENIOR PRODUCT DEVELOPER IN INTERNET-OF-THINGS | SAS INSTITUTE | JAN 2018 - PRESENT

Created models with Machine Learning algorithms for streaming data applications using [SAS’s Event Stream Processing](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/event-stream-processing.html) (ESP) platform for IoT.  Fluent in cloud enabled technologies including Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, Node, React, etc.  Applications were largely paid Proof-of-Concept projects and not publishable.  The subject areas of my work and the publications I could submit are listed below:

* Location Analytics:
  * Created models for conference and retail spaces with intelligent user profiles based on location tracking via smartphones.  [Published Book Chapter, see Publications 1]
  * Social Distancing and contact tracing with Bluetooth enabled badges in office space.
* Digital Twins for visualizing results of AI algorithms in complex systems, especially for building management, towards AR and VR Interfaces.  [Published Paper in IIC Journal, see Publication 2]
* Building Energy Management: Created and applied models to HVAC energy usage to do predictive maintenance, detect anomalies, and run systems more efficiently.
* Healthcare: Identifying physical responses to ozone exposure in healthy individuals via wearables.
* Beehive Monitoring: tracking the health of bees with sensor-connected hives.

Create usable frontend applications for data management in IoT

* Launched internal product called SAS Smart Subscriber that creates a wizard-like workflow for setting up connection information to disparate networks and standardizes metadata into a single system format.  Data could then be loaded into our Analytics for IoT Suite for further analysis.  Product reduced the number of user errors and setup time, streamlined data load between products.

### RESEARCH ASSISTANT | NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY | JUN 2014 – DEC 2017

Designed and executed user study from exploration through user study.  Results verified a cognitive model of user behavior in touchscreen environments, especially related to error recovery and user focus-of-attention.  Funded by EAGER: Cognitive modeling of strategies for dealing with errors in mobile touch interfaces. National Science Foundation Award #1451172. [Published Dissertation, Journal Article, Open-Source Contribution, 2 papers, see Publications 3-7]

### ADJUNCT PROFESSOR | ART INSTITUTE OF RALEIGH-DURHAM | JUN 2014-SEP 2015

Designed the curriculum and taught multiple sections of two classes: “Introduction to Webpage Scripting/Design” that introduced on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, and “Programming for the Artist” that introduced The Unity Game Engine and the C# language. Classes revolved around project-based activities that built on each other week after week.  The final project was a portfolio project that could be shown publicly in job interviews, etc.

### TEACHERS ASSISTANT | NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY | SEP 2013- JUN 2014

TA for undergraduate and graduate sections of Human-Computer Interaction. Guest-lectured, proctored exams, held office hours for students, and graded assignments and tests.

### GRADUATE DEVELOPER INTERN | EPOCRATES | JUN 2013 – SEP 2013

Worked with interface designers, the QA team, and senior developers to make meaningful contributions to the Epocrates iOS interface that were released to users, including 50% of all doctors in the US.

### PROTOTYPE ENGINEER | APPTIVITI | JUN 2012 – DEC 2013

Designed and implemented a tablet-based bill-splitting application for flagship product (Startup).
UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH FELLOW | VASSAR COLLEGE  | JUN 2009 – MAY 2012

Worked with Dr. Marc Smith and Dr. Barry Jones in the Computer Science Department on research projects spanning subjects from mathematical music theory to bioinformatics.

### ACADEMIC INTERN | VASSAR COLLEGE  | JUN 2009 – MAY 2012

Leadership role managing other undergraduate TA’s.  Assisted professors in administering lab courses and covered lectures.  Created tutoring schedules for upperclassmen to ensure coverage for introductory students.
